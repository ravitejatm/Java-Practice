// what is on object?
//object is a instance of class. class is a blueprint it contain verables and methods, to access thes we need to allocate memory. memory allocate process is called object
// after ther we can access verables and methods. while creating object internally it will call constructor

public class Objectss {
    //object is a instance of class
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Objectss obj = new Objectss(); // Creating object using constructor.
        Objectss obj1 = new Objectss();
        Objectss obj2 = new Objectss();
        //class varable operatior new keyword constructor

        //obj  ==! obj1 is not same there address is not same every value is same


        //Objectss ob = new otherclass();
    }
